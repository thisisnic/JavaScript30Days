## 2 - JS and CSS Clock

Topics:

* using the mousemove event for smooth transitions

## 4 - Array Cardio

Topics:

* using array functions ( => )
* console.table
* concatenating strings manually and using template strings
* sorting arrays using the sort method
* bubble sorts
* the ternary operator
* using the reduce method
* initialising values returned from reduce
* converting nodeLists to arrays
* selecting from nodeLists
* combining map and filter
* creating arrays using the split method
* initialising reduce when full set of keys for key/value pairs are not known

## 5 - Flex Panel Gallery

Topics: 

* using the CSS Flexbox Layout module

* extracting HTTP request responses
* spreading data into an array
* using the push method to append arrays
* regex
* using the 'replace' method
* manually generating HTML components
* using innerHTML to assign new content
* keyup vs. change events

## 7 - Array Cardio 2

Topics: 

* checking with some and every
* searching with find and findIndex

* Showing objects as groups in the console
* Timing operations in the console

## 10 - Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes

This exercise was slightly different in that it was the first one I completed entirely by myself before viewing the answer provided.

New things learned:

* click events have the property shiftKey which tells you whether the shift key was held whilst the user clicked
* how to loop through objects to compare to the current (this) object
* how to use flags which are negated when the start/end condition is met

## 11 - Custom Video Player

* splicing the array to only keep the last N elements
* using join to convert array to a strings
* using includes to search within a string

## 13 - Slide in on Scroll

Topics:

* debouncing eventListeners
* using the window's height and scrollX properties

## 14 - JavaScript References VS Copying

Topics:

* copying strings, numbers, and booleans
